## About me

Hey, I’m **Shivam**, a.k.a. `whoami`.

I spend most of my time watching anime, pwning binaries, and professionally procrastinating. This blog exists mainly as a **memory dump for my future self**, because past-me has a habit of forgetting things right after saying, *“I’ll remember this.”*

It’s also my not-so-subtle **New Year’s resolution** to finally fight procrastination — or at least keep it under control — by forcing myself to learn something new about pwn every day and write it down here instead of pretending I’ll “do it later”.

I play CTFs with my college team **[InfoSecIITR](https://ctftime.org/team/16691)**, where I break programs, question my life choices, and occasionally learn something useful.

In the near future, I plan to dive deeper into **kernel exploitation** and **V8 exploitation**, because apparently userland wasn’t painful enough and debugging at 3 AM builds character.

## Achievements

1. Still alive (arguably the hardest challenge).
2. Noob pwner (for now).
3. Orange belt at **[pwn.college](https://pwn.college/hacker/121187)**.
4. Constantly learning… failing… and learning again.

## Goals / TODO

- Learn **kernel exploitation** without immediately panicking.
- Understand **V8 exploitation**.
- Explore **Blockchain Security**.
- Learn at least **one new pwn concept every day** (even on bad days).
- Write proper CTF writeups instead of leaving half-finished notes.
- Break harder things. Fix nothing. Repeat.
